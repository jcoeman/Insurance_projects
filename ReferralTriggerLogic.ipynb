    "# Underwriting Guidelines Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Jupyter Notebook is to develop a logical framework capable of determining whether an arbitrary underwriter has the authority to quote an insurance submission. This problem is approached using principles from object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm design, with an emphasis on time and space efficiency for guideline lookups and authority verification. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The core task is to design an `is_authorized()` method. Given an arbitrary underwriter and submission, it should return whether the submission falls within the underwriter’s authority to quote, and if not, provides the reason why. It is written in the form `underwriter.is_authorized(submission)`. Later on we will randomly generate submissions and test the capability of an underwriter, and an underwriting manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Design\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, two main classes are defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Underwriter: representing the underwriter’s authority parameters. Each underwriter has:\n",
    "- A name\n",
    "- A maximum premium authority limit. This is typically based on modified premium.\n",
    "- Minimum and maximum experience rating modification (XMOD) bounds\n",
    "- A list of territories they are permitted to write business in\n",
    "- A managerial level indicator, since certain class codes require managerial authority to approve. If their managerial level is 1 then they are a manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: `is_authorized()`: This method evaluates a submission against these rules, checking:\n",
    "- If the submission’s modified premium is within authority\n",
    "- If the experience rating (XMOD) is within allowable limits\n",
    "- If all submission territories are authorized\n",
    "- If the submission contains class codes requiring managerial referral\n",
    "\n",
    "The method will return false at the first failure, checking first modified premium, Xmod, territory, and lastly class code. This order was selected because the complexity of the subsequent verficiation is larger. For instance, the premium verification is a simple check, `submission.modified_premium > underwriter.premium_authority` whereas the class code authority performs a lookup into the underwriting guidelines dictionary, and a lookup into the incidental dictionary, and performs this lookup for each class code in the submission. For scalability, reducing the algorithmic complexity is important. If there were thousands of submissions, we would be performing many unnecessary checks. As a sidenote, this is referred to as the partial authorization function. One can also define a 'full' authorization function that returns every single failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Submission: representing an account or risk being quoted. A submission includes:\n",
    "- A name\n",
    "- A dictionary of class codes and their exposure basis\n",
    "- An Xmod\n",
    "- A list of territories\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission class also computes:\n",
    "- Manual Premium: The sum of `exposure * class_rate`\n",
    "- Modified Premium: `manual_premium * Xmod`\n",
    "- The share of total manual premium attributable to each class code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Structure Design\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Guidelines\n",
    "Dictionaries were developed to define the underwriting rules per class code. Each class code is designated as either standard or managerial, with an optional additional dictionary for incidental threshold percentages. This allows flexibility for classes that require referral only when their exposure share exceeds a defined threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "managerial_guideline_dictionary = {}\n",
    "incidental_threshold_guidelines_dictionary = {}\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python dictionaries provide average-case $O(1)$ lookups. The theoretical worst case is $O(n)$ but this is effectively a non-issue for normal workloads. In practice, dict lookups are constant-time for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incidental threshold guidelines is technically able to be combined with the managerial guideline dictionary to reduce storage, but the access structure becomes fairly awkward, hence why an additional dictionary for incidental thresholds was selected. For instance, in a combined guideline dictionary the data structure could look like this: `{8810: [1, 0.1]}`. In this hypothetical, class code 8810 is a managerial class code, and is acceptable incidentally up to a threshold of 10%. However to access either of these values `guideline[8810]` results in a list structure. Access is position dependent, `flag = guideline[cc][0]` and `threshold = guideline[cc][1]`. The code readability suffers at call sites. Python lists also don't have a `.get()` method like dictionaries do which makes defaulting for values potentially not in the guideline more difficult if for instance, a glitched class code were to appear. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code in practice looks like this: `submission.class_manual_percent(cc) > incidental_threshold_guidelines_dictionary.get(cc, 0.0)`. The tradeoff in additional storage for the ability to apply `.get` with a default value is why this was method was preferred over the listed guideline method. The two-dictionary layout trades a negligible amount of memory for clean defaults, simpler code, and easier maintenance, which improves correctness and readability without meaningful performance loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lines of code, the WCIRB pure premium rates are imported as a base rate dictionary and the managerial/incidental guidelines dictionaries are populated. These guidelines are randomized, with a 10% chance of each class code being a managerial class code, and the incidental thresholds being set according to $ U \\sim \\text{unif}(0.05,0.25)$ rounded to 4 decimal places. A brief snapshot of the guidelines will also be displayed."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully developed a logical and scalable framework for automating underwriting authority checks using object-oriented programming principles. The implementation included both data and class structures that mirror real-world underwriting logic, ensuring each component remains modular, interpretable, and computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class Design and Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We defined a robust schema for Underwriter, Submission, and Guideline objects.\n",
    "- Underwriter encapsulates decision authority (premium, XMOD, territory, managerial level).\n",
    "- Submission models real account characteristics (class codes, exposures, territories, XMOD, and calculated premiums).\n",
    "- Global dictionaries store guideline parameters (managerial flags and incidental thresholds), ensuring clarity, flexibility, and constant-time lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simulation and Testing\n",
    "- Generated 20 randomized submissions to test the authority logic across various exposure mixes, XMODs, and territories.\n",
    "- Each case was evaluated using underwriter.is_authorized(submission), confirming that the system properly identified whether an account was within authority and, when not, returned the correct referral reason.\n",
    "- Results were visualized in a pandas DataFrame to ensure no missed cases or logic inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting system demonstrates that underwriting guidelines can be efficiently modeled through structured, object-oriented logic and dictionary-based data management. The approach balances algorithmic efficiency, transparency, and real-world adaptability—providing a foundation that can scale to more complex multi-line authority frameworks or integrate seamlessly with a production underwriting platform."
